    <p>Hi. thisis <b>journal entry on 9/25/23</b>. This is after we did the rube gold
    berg machine. After cadding, the buildig process was pretty easy. Except for when we 
    had problems with the ball dropping to fast. To fix this we added a counter weight,
    so it would drop slower </p>

  <p><b>journal entry 10/6/23</b> we made a cardboard arm that can pick up a 
  water bottle. We realized the problem was the strings got in the way so to fix this we cut a hole through the hand
  to grab the strings from the other side.</p>
