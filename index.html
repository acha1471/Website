    <p>Im pretty sure this was the first one i was supposed to do. Around when school started
    and when we first learned basic coding. It was pretty cool when I made my first website for the world to see</p>

     <b><p>journal entry on september 11</p></b> 
     <p>This is right when we finished the rube goldberg machine. I forgot to update 
     my website, so more will be explained on a later journal entry.</p>

    <p>This is after we did the rube gold
    berg machine. After our team did the cadding, the buildig process was pretty easy and fun. Except for when we 
    had problems with the ball dropping to fast. To fix this we added a counter weight,
    so it would drop slower. Below are pictures </p>

  <p>we made a cardboard arm that can pick up a 
  water bottle. We thought we had it working but then We realized the problem was the strings got in the
  way. So to fix this we cut a hole through the hand
  to grab the strings from the other side. This allowed us to grab it like a Real hand.</p>

      <p>On monday the 16th, we began our construction a water bottle that could fly. We 
      cadded first, then on wednesday, we faced our first problem. We brought the wrong size bottle. 
      We got clowned on but we still persisted and made our rocket look cool with 8 fins. In terms of flight, 
      we didn't do so well. It might be because no one knew, including us, how much pressure and how much water 
      to put in the rocket. Or it could have been because our design was not the best. We had fun though.

       <p>Today we made a water filter. The materials were a soda bottle, cotton, dirt
       sand, small rocks and big rocks. We did a design that was cotton,small rocks, dirt then big rocks.
       Then the "correct design" of cotto,n sand, small rocks, then big rocks, but it was double layerd
       Honestly the incorrect design worked better. This might be because of the double layers and how 
       the sand is still dirty in some way so the already clean water because a little dirtier.</p>
